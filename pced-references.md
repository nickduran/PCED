# PCED Facets and Supporting References

## 1. Option Presentation and Decision Point Recognition  
**Supportive References:**  
**Elwyn et al. (2012)** – *Shared Decision Making: A Model for Clinical Practice*  
Introduces the Three-Talk Model, emphasizing “Choice Talk” to highlight decision points and present multiple viable options.

**Elwyn et al. (2014)** – *Collaborative Deliberation*  
Describes decision point recognition as a core of deliberation, and presents “Recognition of Alternatives” as a key proposition.

**Braddock et al. (1999)** – *Informed Decision Making*  
Lists “discussion of the nature of the decision” and “discussion of alternatives” as essential elements in a decision-making process.

---

## 2. Information Exchange About Options  
**Supportive References:**  
**Elwyn et al. (2013)** – *Observer OPTION-5*  
Includes “Information exchange” as one of the five observable behaviors needed to support SDM.

**Hayat et al. (2020)** – *Understanding patient–provider email communication*  
Content analysis showed that while deliberative content is rare, information-giving dominates—highlighting its role as a precursor or enabler for deliberation.

**Weiss & Peters (2008)** – *OPTION vs IDM*  
Found that IDM emphasizes information elements (e.g., discussing benefits/risks), while OPTION captures broader interaction—validating the importance of clear explanation of options.

---

## 3. Preference Expression and Elicitation  
**Supportive References:**  
**Elwyn et al. (2014)** – *Collaborative Deliberation*  
Explicitly calls out “Preference construction and elicitation” and “Preference integration” as essential and often co-constructed during dialogue.

**Elwyn et al. (2013)** – *Observer OPTION-5*  
Includes preference elicitation and integration as key observable behaviors.

**Lewis (2019)** – *Relational Autonomy*  
Emphasizes that true autonomy depends on recognizing and integrating patient preferences within the social and relational context of care.

---

## 4. Tradeoffs or Comparisons Articulation  
**Supportive References:**  
**Braddock et al. (1999)** – *Informed Decision Making*  
Includes “discussion of the risks and benefits” as a necessary component of a shared decision.

**Elwyn et al. (2014)** – *Collaborative Deliberation*  
Lists “Comparative learning” as a core proposition—explicitly referring to weighing options in relation to one another.

**Moyer et al. (2004)** – *Content analysis of patient–provider email*  
Although mostly transactional, this study highlighted rare instances where tradeoffs were discussed, revealing how such articulation signals depth of deliberation.

---

## 5. Collaborative Deliberation or Negotiation  
**Supportive References:**  
**Elwyn et al. (2014)** – *Collaborative Deliberation*  
The entire framework is devoted to the idea of joint, negotiated decision-making, with language and behavior markers (e.g., “constructive engagement”).

**Jarad Fodeh et al. (2023)** – *Identifying patient-centered communication in secure messages*  
Finds that both clinicians and patients can initiate collaborative dialogue, and that partnership statements (like joint planning) do appear in asynchronous text.

**Bunt & Petukhova (2020)** – *ISO 24617-2 and RIAS*  
Proposes an annotation framework where speech acts like "propose decision" or "negotiate plan" are explicitly coded, enabling identification of collaborative turns in medical conversation.
