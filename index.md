# PCED Coding Guide for Secure Messages
This guide provides instructions for coding **patient-provider exchanges** for Potential Comparative Effectiveness Deliberations (PCED). 

## Core Rationale
This coding approach requires understanding patient-provider exchanges as **potentialities or opportunities for and enactment of compartive effectiveness deliberations.** Patients can create possibilities (whether intentional or not) for providers to engage in comparative effectiveness reasoning **about treatment/management options**, but only providers can actually deliver comparative effectiveness explanations about options. This coding approach assumes that the patient-initiated potentialities can vary in strength and that provider responses can vary in quality of engagement. 
Therefore, we code:  
1. **Patient opportunity creation** (strength of potential). See the [Stage 1 Patient Coding Instructions](stage-1-patient-coding).
2. **Provider engagement** (whether and how they respond). See the [Stage 2 Provider Coding Instructions](stage-2-provider-coding-context).

## BASIC PROCEDURE

#### Step 1: Identify the Exchange Unit
- Identify the **entire thread** and be clear which messages in the thread are from provider and which are from the patient (typically 2-6 messages)

#### Step 2: Code Patient Language (**STAGE 1**)
Ask: "What opportunity, if any, does the patient create (whether intentional or not) for the provider to engage in comparative effectiveness deliberation **about treatment/management options**?" 
- There are 5 possible codes (P0-P4) that you will select from a dropdown menu in the spreadsheet. For explanation of each code, see the [Stage 1 Patient Coding Instructions](stage-1-patient-coding)

<!-- - **P0**: No request for guidance on treatment
- **P1**: General help-seeking without specifics
- **P2**: Asks about alternatives (open-ended) OR speculates on causes OR expresses dissatisfaction
- **P3**: Names 2+ specific treatments patient is considering
- **P4**: Explicitly requests comparison or tradeoffs -->

#### Step 3: Code Provider Language (**STAGE 2**)
Ask: "How does the provider respond?" 
- There are 5 possible codes (R0-R4) that you will select from a dropdown menu in the spreadsheet. For explanation of each code, see the [Stage 2 Provider Coding Instructions](stage-2-provider-coding-context).

<!-- - **R0**: No clinical engagement (acknowledgment/deferral only)
- **R1**: Discusses multiple causes but no treatment options
- **R2**: Provides single treatment solution (or multiple as combined approach)
- **R3**: Presents 2+ treatment options with minimal elaboration
- **R4**: Presents 2+ treatment options with substantial elaboration -->

#### Step 4: Code Context Columns (ONLY MARK IF YES)
For each provider message, code:
- **Non-primary provider?**: Is the respondent someone other than the patient's primary/attending physician?
- **Defers to in-person?**: Does the provider explicitly suggest meeting in-person or by phone?
- **Core response canned?**: Does the response appear templated or generic rather than personalized?

## DECISION FLOWCHART CHEATSHEET
When starting to code, you should have a copy of the cheatsheet visibile as a reference as you begin. Use the cheatsheet once you sufficiently understand the code explanations in [Stage 1 Patient Coding Instructions](stage-1-patient-coding), [Stage 2 Provider Coding Instructions](stage-2-provider-coding-context), and the [Coding Examples](examples).

STAGE 1: Patient Opportunity Assessment

Patient Codes (building progressively):
  
  P0: WITHOUT requesting guidance on treatment
  P1: + requests guidance WITHOUT mentioning specific treatment options  
  P2: + asks about alternatives WITHOUT naming specific treatment options OR speculates on causes OR expresses dissatisfaction
  P3: + names 2+ specific treatment options WITHOUT requesting comparison
  P4: + explicitly requests comparison

STAGE 2: Provider Response Assessment

Provider Codes:
  
  R0: No clinical engagement (acknowledgement only)
  R1: Discusses causes only
  R2: Gives treatment solution(s) (non-comparative)
  R3: Gives 2+ comparative treatment options, minimal detail
  R4: Gives 2+ comparative treatment options with elaboration
