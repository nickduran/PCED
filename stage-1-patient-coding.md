## STAGE 1: Patient Assessment
**Primary Decision Rule**: Does the patient create an opportunity for the provider to engage in comparative effectiveness deliberation about treatment/management options?

#### Quick Reference: Patient Code Meanings
- **P0 - No Opportunity**: Patient does NOT request guidance on treatment decision (acknowledgment, information sharing, or gratitude only)
- **P1 - Weak Opportunity**: Requests guidance on treatment but mentions ZERO treatments by name
- **P2 - Moderate Opportunity**: Requests guidance and mentions treatment(s) as **context** (current medications, what they've tried, background information)
- **P3 - Strong Opportunity**: Requests guidance and presents treatment(s) as **alternatives/choices** to deliberate or compare between

## Decision Table

| Code | Requests guidance on treatment? | Mentions treatment(s)? | How are treatments framed? | Example |
|------|------|------|------|----------|
| **P0** | **NO** | Any | — | "Thanks for calling in the refill." / "I picked up the prescription today." / "I'm taking the Aleve you recommended and it's working great!" |
| **P1** | **YES** | **NO** (0 treatments mentioned) | — | "I've been having stomach pain for three days. What should I do?" / "My knee is really bothering me. Can you help?" / "I'm not sure if this is allergies or an infection. What are your thoughts?" |
| **P2** | **YES** | **YES** (1+ treatments mentioned) | As **context/background** (current meds, what they've tried) | "I'm on Aleve but it's not helping. What else can I try?" / "I've tried Tylenol and it didn't work. What should I do?" / "I'm on steroids and Aleve, but can I try Ibuprofen?" |
| **P3** | **YES** | **YES** (1+ treatments mentioned) | As **alternatives/choices** to compare or choose between | "Should I continue physical therapy or get the cortisone injection?" / "What are the pros and cons of Aleve versus Ibuprofen?" / "I heard infrared light treatment is best, but what are the alternatives?" / "Which would work better - the cream or the pills?" |

#### Note 
- **Key:** Focus on treatment/management options. Speculation about causes is fine at any level but doesn't affect coding. See [Coding Examples](examples) if you would like additional clarification.
