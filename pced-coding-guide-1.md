# PCED Coding Guide for Secure Messages

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for identifying Potential Collaborative Effectiveness Deliberations (PCED) in physician-patient secure messages. PCEDs are interactions where physician and patient collaboratively discuss multiple treatment or management options.

## Coding Decision Rules

A message contains PCED if it meets **BOTH** of the following criteria:

1. **The message must reference at least TWO distinct treatment or management options**
   
   AND
   
2. **The message must contain at least ONE of the following elements:**
   - Information Exchange About Options
   - Preference Expression or Elicitation
   - Collaborative Deliberation Markers

## Detailed Explanation of Elements

### Option Presentation and Recognition (Required)
*The presence or acknowledgment of multiple treatment/management choices*

**Indicators:**
- Explicit mention of multiple options existing
- Asking about alternative approaches
- Comparing two or more options

**Examples:**
> "We could either try the steroid cream first or refer you to a dermatologist."
> 
> "Should I continue with physical therapy or consider getting the cortisone injection we discussed?"

### Information Exchange About Options
*Sharing factual information about the different choices available*

**Indicators:**
- Explanation of how options work
- Description of benefits/risks of different options
- Patient sharing experience with various options
- Questions to clarify understanding of option details

**Examples:**
> "The oral antibiotic would likely clear this up faster, but might cause stomach upset. The topical cream would be gentler but takes longer to work and you'd need to apply it 3x daily."
> 
> "I tried the nasal spray you suggested, but it caused severe dryness. What differences should I expect with the pill option?"

### Preference Expression and Elicitation
*Communication about personal values and priorities related to options*

**Indicators:**
- Asking about patient's preferences or concerns
- Patient expressing what matters to them regarding decisions
- Relating options to patient's specific life circumstances or values

**Examples:**
> "Which of these approaches would fit better with your daily routine?"
> 
> "I'm concerned about side effects that might interfere with my work, so I prefer the option with fewer daytime symptoms."

### Collaborative Deliberation Markers
*Indications that options are being actively weighed or considered together*

**Indicators:**
- Language indicating joint consideration (e.g., "we," "let's decide")
- Explicit weighing of pros/cons across options
- Expressions of uncertainty requiring joint resolution
- Back-and-forth questions and responses regarding options

**Examples:**
> "Let's think about whether surgery or medication management makes more sense given your activity goals."
> 
> "I'm weighing the trade-offs between these medications and would value your input on which direction to go."

## Coding Process

1. Read the entire message carefully
2. Determine if at least two distinct treatment/management options are referenced
3. If yes, look for at least one of the three additional elements
4. Mark the message as containing PCED if both criteria are met
5. If either criterion is not met, mark as NOT containing PCED

## Important Notes

- Focus on the content of the individual message being coded, not the entire thread
- Both patient and physician messages can contain PCED
- Options must be active treatments or management approaches (not just diagnostic possibilities)
- The mere mention of multiple options is not sufficient; there must be substantive engagement with the options

## Examples of Complete Messages

### Contains PCED
> "Dr. Smith, I've been taking the lisinopril for 2 weeks now but I'm experiencing a dry cough that's quite bothersome. I read this could be a side effect. Could we try a different medication like the losartan you mentioned as an alternative at my last visit? I'm concerned about dealing with this cough long-term, especially since I do public speaking for work."

*Analysis: References two options (lisinopril and losartan), shares information about current treatment effects, and expresses preferences related to work needs.*

### Does NOT Contain PCED
> "Dr. Smith, I've been taking the lisinopril for 2 weeks now but I'm experiencing a dry cough that's quite bothersome. I read this could be a side effect. Is this normal? Should I be concerned?"

*Analysis: Only references one treatment option (lisinopril), without discussion of alternatives.*
